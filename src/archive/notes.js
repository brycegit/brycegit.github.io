/**
 * Design patterns
 *
 * Composite - treat both items and groups of items the same
 *
 * Strategy - externalize an algorithm so you can choose which to use at run time
 *
 * Decorator - add responsibilities to an existing object
 *
 * Abstract Factory - create products of a certain family based on a single variable
 *
 * Bridge - establish an interface between two classes so each can evolve independently
 *
 * Command - encapsulate a request by wrapping it in a uniform interface
 *
 * Iterator - enables access/traversal of an object without exposing the data structure
 *
 * Visitor - perform an action by providing any visitor object
 *
 * Builder - allows complex objects to be constructed in multiple steps
 *
 * Factory - encapsulates logic for creating different types of products
